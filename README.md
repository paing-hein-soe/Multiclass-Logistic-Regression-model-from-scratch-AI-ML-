# Multiclass-Logistic-Regression-model-from-scratch-AI-ML-
Building an end-to-end machine learning model from scratch is a great way to understand every stepâ€”from data collection to model training.  In this project, you will see a Multiclass Logistic Regression model (a classification model) that allows hands-on experimentation.
