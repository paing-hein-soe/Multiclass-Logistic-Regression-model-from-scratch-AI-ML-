# Multiclass-Logistic-Regression-model-from-scratch-AI-ML-
Building an end-to-end machine learning model from scratch is a great way to understand every step—from data collection to model training.  In this project, you will see a Multiclass Logistic Regression model (a classification model) that allows hands-on experimentation. 

# Sharing an AI/ML Hands-on Project for Learning & Experimentation from Scratch 📊
If you're curious about developing AI/ML models, building an end-to-end machine learning project from scratch is one of the best ways to understand every step—from data collection to model training.

In this project, I implemented Multiclass Logistic Regression, which is a classification model that allows hands-on experimentation and practical learning. 🚀

Rather than focusing on pure accuracy, the real value here is building everything from the ground up—so you can try, modify, and play with it as a whole.
